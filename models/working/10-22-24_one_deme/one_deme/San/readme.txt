one-deme models for the Khomani-San population. comments on individual models:

two stem with migration: both the early and entire-split-time migration models attain high likelihood- the initial parameters were already relatively close to the fit values.
with/without migration, the join time parameter behaves pathologically. with migration, and starting from initial value 100 kya, we infer join times as recent as 7kya- without migration or from earlier initial values we get probably unrealistically old times on the order of 250kya.

fixing TK at 120kya leads to very reasonable estimates...

one-deme size change models: I wasn't able to get these to behave here, but my search was very minimal. possibly an exhaustive search of different epoch arrangements would produce a good fit.
