Here I'm going to try to build a set of tree-like models for the Yoruba and
Khomani-San demes using the results I gathered in `exploratory`. These results
suggested that a single ancient size increase (1-2Ma) does a relatively good
job fitting both curves in simple two-epoch (3-parameter) one-deme models. 

Without any further elaborations or simplifications, this model has 6 parameters
NA0
TA0
NA1
TA1 [split time]
NK
NY

Getting H2[K,Y] high enough to fit without very old divergence times may be
tricky.
