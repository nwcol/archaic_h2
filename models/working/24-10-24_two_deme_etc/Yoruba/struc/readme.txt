It seems reasonable to fix the formation time of YRI, the fusion proportions and possibly one of the ancestral stem sizes to reduce identifiability problems which are probaby rife in this model.
Branch admixture proportions can be re-estimated later when the addition of other sampled demes makes this more feasible
Ancestral Ne can likely be estimated via direct search
