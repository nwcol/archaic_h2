Here I present a bunch of models inferred with NA fixed at various times. 
I also fix the time of the deep split between Khomani-San and Yoruba because it
has previously proved poorly-constrained.

Grid of fixed parameters:
    NA 12k 14k 16k 18k 20k
    TA (split K/YF) 100ka 120ka 150ka 180ka => 20 models

The model has 5 free parameters:
NK
NYF
TYF
NY
NF

A potentially better model might include a size change several hundred thousand
years ago, allowing an 'MH' epoch with larger population size which seems to 
give better fits...
