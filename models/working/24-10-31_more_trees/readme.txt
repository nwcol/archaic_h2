My focus today is fitting tree demograms for archaic/modern demes seperately and
trying to join them together.

I tried to accomplish this by fitting replicates across grids of ancestral 
population size/ancestral population end time. I think this idea has promise but
today's efforts were largely in vain. It appears that to explain the levels of
polymorphism that exist in the data, the ancestral human population size must 
be large (on the order of 20,000 or 22,000?). 

Future efforts fitting modern, Neandertal, and Neandertal+Denisovan statistics
across grids will probably be promising in constructing the tree model.
