Here I enumerate some topological choices I've been thinking about.

The general shape of the topology might be
- Tree-like, with demes formed by bifurcation from a common ancestor
- Branched and reticulated by deme mergers, with divergent ancestral stems rejoining in merger events
    - How deep does ancestral structure run? How antique is the split between south/west Africans, etc
- Branched and reticulated by migrations, which would probably be relatively intense

- In the structured-ancestry case;
    - Neandertal/Denisovan divergence before or after emergence of structure?
    - MH groups in east/south Africa formed seperately from stems, or derived from single fusion?
    - Do the stems actually merge, or just interact via continuous migration?
