I'm trying a technique here which I have not previously used; fixing the ancestral Ne at a value which I recovered in one-deme simulations on the 22nd, I infer one-deme demograms and try to join them by just inferring the split time.

notes:
- Yoruba needs a large (~20000) ancestral Ne to fit at all. 

this was sort of fruitless.
