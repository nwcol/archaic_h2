Here I add another epoch to the Vindija deme to represent the population contraction which is hypothesized for Neandertals. 
The contraction time was found manually and is not a free parameter- a few fits with different epoch times are saved here

these fits are substantially better than those which force a single Ne upon Vindija for its history

150ka problems with N/MH split time (1Mya is not realistic)

400ka also goes to 1Ma divergence and really high Vindija Ne
>500ka gives absurdly high Vinija Ne (I neglected to bound this parameter)

the 150ka contraction time is the best here
