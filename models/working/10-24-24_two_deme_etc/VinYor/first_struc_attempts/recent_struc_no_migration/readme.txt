This model includes structure without migration along the Yoruba lineage (Ne in the minor-contribution stem is fixed) that postdates the human-Neandertal divergence.

for reasons of identifiability:
- N2 is fixed at 20000
- Yoruba formation time is fixed at 100000ka
- N/Y divergence and stem split time are free, but stem split time must < N/D divergence
