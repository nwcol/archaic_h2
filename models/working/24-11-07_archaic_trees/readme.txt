Some uncertainties in writing the archaic null model;
    (1) size changes in archaics? avoid if possible (adds epochs)
    (2) size change in modern human? likely necessary
    (3) which modern human? maybe Yoruba
    (4) proxy OOA population to model migration back intro Africa?
        to allow indirect Neandertal flow into Africans
    (5) migrations among Neandertals, Denisovans- necessary for a good fit?
        parsimonious? how early should N-D migration start?

I take and improve the model written on November 6th in the full_models/ dir.


exploratory/pulses

Here I check how much the second pulse from MH -> CV matters by inserting it 
into a model I wrote on the 4th. This is very rough and meant only to get an 
idea of the magnitude of the effect.
Predictably, the first pulse with ~0.05 (or possible 0.10!!!) has an immense
effect. The second pulse is much more slight but it should still be included
at least in a subset of models based on this result. It seems it may be 
necessary to fit over a grid to incorporate these two uncertainties.

For now I am going to run with the 200ka/0.05 version because it seems more 
realistic (at least naively) and less extreme.
