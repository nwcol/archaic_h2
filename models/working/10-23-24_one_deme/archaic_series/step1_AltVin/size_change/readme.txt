some of the possible scenarios involving Ne in the `ND` deme and Neandertal stem lineage are:

- demes remain small across time, possibly contracting
- small ND and subsequent N expansion followed by contraction
- large ND with early bottleneck in N stem ~ (seperate dispersal of derived groups from Africa?)
